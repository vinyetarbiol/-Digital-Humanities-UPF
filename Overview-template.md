## Hi there 👋 I'm Celine

### 🔭 I'm currently working on improving FAIR practices in the phytolith research community with ICOPS.
- ICOPS is involved in the training and communication of open science tools (GitHub) for phytolith researchers.
- We are trying to develop ontologies dedicated to the study of phytoliths.
  
### My personal research focuses on the physical properties of plants and plant-based technologies.

- I am using a participant-observation approach to learn about the raw materials, techniques, technology, and purposes of basket making. 
- I aim to learn how practitioners assess the properties or qualities of the materials they use, and how the materials are related to end products and uses.


### 🌱 I’m currently learning: 
- how to use open science tools
- how to make baskets from plant-based raw materials and plastics,
- how to create compost and bokashi compost from trash!

### 👯 I’m looking for collaboration around sustainability and responsible science
